1. check when a user modifies the file by
adding a false identifier with the true ones preseent
2. Check if its a valid file

Strategy:
Read the map using get_next_line
store the contents in the various strings meant for them
define the identifier in the header seperately
# define North NO
idnetifier => NO SO EA WE F C
map => all others should go here

Identifier:
use their identifier names to store them (NO ) *note the space
count the words and if more than 2, exit
split the identifier and its file name using spaces
check the identifier if it matches the original else end
loop from back and check the filename if it ends with .xpm else end

colors:
split the identifier and others using 
check the identifier if it matches the main one
The integers must be between 0 and 255, inclusive.

map:
copy all the contents of the map
any text without the identifer should be stored in the map
check thru the map and any character not the usual should exit the program

Issues
commas  dont throw error.. check the split using commas and check if the total color array are 3 or more

refactor the code for maps and extract the checks for 1st and last row to another function
if possible get the length of each string and check using the lenght


//start here
				//1. loop thru 1st and last row and check if its only 1s or spaces
				if ((map[0][j] && map[0][j] != '1' && map[0][j] != ' '))
				{
					printf("Error: Map is not closed1.\n");
					exit(0);
				}
				if (map[map_len][j] && map[map_len][j] != '\n' && (map[map_len][j] != '1' && map[map_len][j] != ' '))
				{
					printf("Error: Map is not closed2.\n");
					exit(0);
				}
				//2. check the first and last of every string. space can begin but not end
				if ((map[i][0] != '1' && map[i][0] != ' ') || map[i][ft_strlen(map[i]) - 1] != '1')
				{
					printf("Error: Map is not closed3.\n");
					exit(0);
				}
