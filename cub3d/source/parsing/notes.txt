Things Undone

Norminette:

1. parse_map.c
2. parse_textures.c
3. validate_map.c

2. Check the free of the parse_map && validate map
3. Check if the fd's are closed when exit is called

Unresolved Issues:

1. Allocates zero when a space is passed as a string
arg: F 120, ,90 
output: R: 120, G: 0, B: 90

2. the get_line function seg faults when an empty map is passed
